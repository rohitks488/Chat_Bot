Good morning, Hank . It's Thursday, January 4th .  I'm standing on top of Little Pisgah Mountain in North Carolina . That was actually recorded on Wednesday, January 3rd, but you'd have no way of knowing .  I believe that's what they call movie magic !  Hank, in your last video you asked me to continue our discussion of our differences . I think one of the most important differences between us is that you are excellent at living in a way that's commensurate with your values whereas I am not .  Uh, for instance, I didn't recycle until I watched An Inconvenient Truth, and I'm still sorta iffy on it .
Good morning Hank, it's Thur- what ?  What is today ?  What ?  It's Wednesday, January 9th ?  10th ?  10th .  Boy, I'm out of it .     Hi girls who are being used as objects to sell other objects !  Sorry about the patriarchal oppression .  Good luck selling Dodge Caravans !     I was inspired by your video blog yesterday to calculate my own carbon footprint, so, um, I'm gonna go to BP . com and do it, and then it's gonna be pretty boring so I'm gonna speed up the tape
